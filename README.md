Voronoi's IRC bot, by Paul Salden 2012

Proudly infringing various Apple patents

Simple modular IRC bot, created for personal use. I am not a professional coder, nor have I ever received any real
education in the field. There is no doubt this affects the code. Use it for whatever purpose you wish, but do so
at your own risk.

Should you have any questions or wish to speak to me for other reasons, feel welcome to join #pwnagedeluxe on
QuakeNet.
